# Right Lane segmentation in Duckietown environment
Repository for project Duckietown at BME VIK (Budapesti Műszaki és Gazdaságtudományi Egyetem Villamosmérnöki és Informatikai Kar).

## Training, test, validation data for semantics segmentation
Original and annotated video frames can be extracted from gym_duckietown environment using the present scripts. By using these frames from the video files we plan to train, validate and test our network.

For more information on how the data collection and preprocessing was done, please refer to [this wiki page](https://github.com/timurlenk07/onlab_duckietown/wiki/Data-used-for-training,-testing-and-validating-the-network).
