## Training, test, validation data for semantics segmentation
We extracted original and annotated video frames from gym_duckietown environment. By using these frames from the video files found under /recordings directory, we plan to train, test, and validate our network.

For more information on how the data collection and preprocessing was done, please refer to [this](https://github.com/DeepTesla/deep_learning_hf/wiki/Data-used-for-training,-testing-and-validating-the-network) wiki page.
